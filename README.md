# Top Process Meter
**Top Process Meter Gadgets inspired by the well-known AddGadgets.com Windows Sidebar gadgets.**

The Top Process Meter Gadgets monitor the CPU, GPU, RAM, and I/O utilization of the top 10 processes on your computer, with styling to match the [Gadgets](https://github.com/SilverAzide/Gadgets) suite.

These gadgets use the Rainmeter 4.2 UsageMonitor plugin, and as a result do not have the performance problems and functional limitations associated with plugins in earlier versions of Rainmeter. UsageMonitor also is not affected by locale, and will work with any language.

## Features
* Displays 1 to 10 top processes, ordered by CPU/GPU/RAM/IO utilization.
* Displays the amount of memory used by each process.
* Displays graph of total CPU/GPU/RAM/IO utilization (optional).
* Shows Resource Monitor when gadget is double-clicked.
* Scales to any desired size.

**NOTE:**<br>
The installer is in the form of a patch, which will patch your existing [Gadgets](https://github.com/SilverAzide/Gadgets) installation without affecting your existing configuration or layouts. If you don't have the Gadgets suite installed, these will install as standalone skins.

## Requirements
Rainmeter 4.4.0 or later: <https://www.rainmeter.net>.<br>
Top GPU Meter requires Windows 10 Fall Creator's Update (v1709) or later.
